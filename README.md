# 🕵️ Fraud Detection – Handling Imbalanced Datasets  

This project explores different techniques for handling **imbalanced datasets**, applied to a **fraud detection dataset**. The goal is to compare methods like upsampling and downsampling, and evaluate their effect on model performance.

## 📌 Project Highlights
- 📊 **Dataset**: Fraud detection dataset (sourced from GeeksforGeeks, used for educational purposes).  
- 🛠️ **Techniques implemented**:
  - Random Upsampling (increase minority samples)  
  - Random Downsampling (reduce majority samples)  
- 🤝 **Comparison with other approaches**: My method vs. method used in the GFG tutorial.  
- 🧪 **Evaluation**: Effect of balancing techniques on classification results.

## 🚀 Why This Project?
- Demonstrates how to handle **imbalanced data** in machine learning.  
- Highlights the **importance of balancing techniques** in fraud detection problems.  
- Serves as a **reusable template** for handling imbalance in other datasets.

## 🔮 Future Work
This repository will continue to grow with **more techniques, algorithms, and experiments** on the same dataset:  
- Add on new advanced resampling methods (SMOTE ✅, Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN).
- Explore **ensemble methods** like EasyEnsemble, BalanceCascade.  
- Apply cost-sensitive learning and anomaly detection approaches.  
- Experiment with multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Nets).  
- Add **data visualizations** to compare class distribution before and after resampling.  
- Document and compare **new, unique methods** as they are explored.
