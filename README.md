# Handling-Imbalanced-Dataset-Using-Resampling-Technique
This repository explores different techniques to address class imbalance in datasets, with a focus on a fraud detection dataset. Class imbalance is a common challenge in real-world problems where one class (e.g., fraud cases) is significantly underrepresented compared to another (non-fraud cases).

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s inside

Dataset: Fraud detection dataset (sourced from GeeksforGeeks, for educational purposes).

Techniques implemented:

Random Upsampling (increasing minority class samples).

Random Downsampling (reducing majority class samples).

(On Later Stages new Techniques will be shown in this repo).

Comparison of results between methods.

Jupyter Notebook / Python script with clean, reproducible code.

ðŸŽ¯ Why this project?

Demonstrates how to handle imbalanced data in machine learning.

Shows the effect of different resampling strategies on model performance.

Serves as a reusable template for applying imbalance-handling methods to other datasets.

ðŸš€ Future Work

Add advanced resampling methods like SMOTE or ensemble techniques.

Experiment with different classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Visualize class distribution before and after resampling.
